    "[Google Earth Engine (GEE)](https://earthengine.google.com/) is a computing platform that allows users to run geospatial analysis on Google's infrastructure. It brings together the world's satellite imagery from multiple sources â€“ Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS etc. along with access to other secondary climatic and Geo-physical datasets covering entire globe. GEE has become very popular in the geospatial community and numerous environmental applications at local, regional, and global scales have been deployed all over the globe. GEE provides both JavaScript and Python APIs for making computational requests to the Earth Engine servers. \n",
